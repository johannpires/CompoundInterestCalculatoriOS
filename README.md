# CompoundInterestCalculator

An iOS app to calculate Compound Interest with monthly aports. 

This iOS app is my first app in Swift, and I am making an effort to build this Compound Interest Calculator from scratch for personal use. 

## Tecnologies
* Swift

### TO DO
- Improve the UI.
- I want to redo this app using SwiftUI later.
